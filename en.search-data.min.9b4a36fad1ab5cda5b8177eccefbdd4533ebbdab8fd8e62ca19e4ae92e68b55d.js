Initial snapshot contains a full copy of EBS volume. Further snapshots contain only data which changed since the last backup.\n  EBS Snapshots can be used to replicate EBS data to another AZ or region.\n  EBS Snapshots can be automated using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager\n  Permission to created snapshots can be changed even to public.\n  Security Groups  Security Groups are Software Firewals, which can be attached to network interface. Each Elastic Network Interface(ENI) can have up to 5 Security Groups attached There are two type of rules for SG  Inbound Outbound   Default Rule for SG is impliciy deny In Security Group only allow rules are defined. THERE ARE NO EXPLICIT DENIES !!! Security Group is stateful. It means if you allow inbound traffic (for example http connection on port 80), outbound is automatically allowed (SG operates on Level 5 of OSI model**) Security Group can refer to another Security Group. That is used for example when there is a need to allow all trafic inside of SG or from another SG.
